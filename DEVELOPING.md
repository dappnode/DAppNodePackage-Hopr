# Repository structure

There are three repositories:

- official: https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNodePackage-Hopr
- internal: https://github.com/hoprnet/DAppNodePackage-Hopr
- testnet: https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNodePackage-Hopr-Testnet

The `internal` is a fork of the `official` one.  The `testnet` repo is configured specifically to use our `rotsee` testnet

Tha development happens on the internal repository and it has two branches:

- `develop` which contains the edge version, not meant for publishing
- `main` which is supposed to be in-sync with the `main` branch on the `official` repo

PRs are only meant to be made from the `internal` repo's `main` branch to the `official` repo's `main` branch.

# Development process

Clone the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:hoprnet/DAppNodePackage-Hopr.git
```

Build a package with (requires Node.js)

```sh
npx @dappnode/dappnodesdk build
```

This should create output similar to

```
  ✔ Verify connection
  ✔ Verify connection
  ✔ Create release dir
  ✔ Validate files
  ✔ Copy files
  ✔ Build architecture linux/amd64
  ✔ Upload release to IPFS node
  ✔ Save upload results

### Grafana dashboard upgrades

When upgrading the Grafana dashboards, make sure:

- the file is called `hopr-public-grafana-dashboard.json`
- the `uid` property is non-empty and starts with `hopr-public-`

# Debugging

When connected to a DAppnode system, follow the link and install the package. If it is a development build, make sure to disable signature verification before installing the package.

When running with the [DMS package](http://my.dappnode/installer/dnp/dms.dnp.dappnode.eth) (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus):

- [http://prometheus.dms.dappnode:9090/targets](http://prometheus.dms.dappnode:9090/targets) lists Prometheus targets. Make sure the package's target is available

Automatic import of Prometheus targets is only available if `prometheusTargets` and automatic import of Grafana dashboards is only available if `grafanaDashboards` is present in the observed [package manifest](http://my.dappnode/package-manifest/hopr.public.dappnode.eth).
